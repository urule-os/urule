# Urule — A Linux for AI

> A thin, open control plane for AI coworkers that composes open-source projects into one cohesive platform.

Urule doesn't reinvent orchestration, execution, auth, or eventing. It glues together best-in-class open-source tools and only builds the coordination layer — so you can focus on what your AI agents actually do.

**Core principle:** Reuse execution, reuse orchestration, reuse auth, reuse eventing — only build the glue.

## Why Urule?

AI tooling today is fragmented. You need orchestration (LangGraph, CrewAI), sandboxed execution, approval workflows, tool registries, multi-channel routing, and a UI — but no single project provides the coordination layer that ties them together.

Urule is that layer. It's designed to be:

- **Composable** — Swap orchestrators, add channels, install widgets. Everything is pluggable.
- **Extendable** — Build widgets, orchestrator adapters, channel adapters, and package types.
- **Open** — Every component is Apache 2.0 licensed. Standalone components work outside Urule too.

Items marked with ★ are **standalone repos** that can be used independently of Urule.

## Ecosystem

Urule is split across multiple repositories. Some are generic and usable independently; others are Urule-specific.

## How to Extend Urule

### Build a Widget

Widgets are micro-frontends that plug into the Office UI. Use the [Widget SDK](https://github.com/urule-os/widget-sdk) to build one:

1. Define a `WidgetManifest` with your widget's metadata
2. Implement your widget as a React component or iframe-based app
3. Use the bridge protocol for host communication
4. Register it in the widget registry

See the [Widget SDK docs](https://github.com/urule-os/widget-sdk) for details.

### Add an Orchestrator

Implement the [Orchestrator Contract](https://github.com/urule-os/orchestrator-contract) to integrate any AI framework:

1. Implement the `OrchestratorAdapter` interface (8 methods)
2. Run the compliance test suite to verify correctness
3. Deploy as a Fastify service
4. Register with the Urule registry

See the [langgraph-adapter](https://github.com/urule-os/langgraph-adapter) for a reference implementation.

### Add a Channel

Add a new messaging channel to the [Channel Router](https://github.com/urule-os/channel-router):

1. Implement the `ChannelAdapter` interface
2. Normalize messages into the unified format
3. Register the adapter

See the [Channel Router docs](https://github.com/urule-os/channel-router) for a step-by-step guide.

### Create a Package

Urule supports 11 package types: `personality`, `skill`, `tool`, `mcp-connector`, `widget`, `theme`, `workflow`, `integration`, `template`, `runtime-profile`, `governance-policy`.

Each package has a manifest validated against the `@urule/spec` JSON Schema.

## Tech Stack

| Concern | Choice |
|---------|--------|
| Language | TypeScript (ESM) |
| HTTP framework | Fastify 5 |
| ORM | Drizzle ORM |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 (schema-per-service) |
| Test runner | Vitest |
| Container | Docker multi-stage (node:20-slim) |
| ID generation | ULID |
| Events | NATS + JetStream |
| Auth | Keycloak (authn) + OpenFGA (authz) |
| Frontend | Next.js 14, React 18, Tailwind CSS, Zustand |

## Design Principles

1. **Services are glue, not business logic.** If a service exceeds ~2000 lines, it's doing too much.
2. **Contract-first.** Types and interfaces live in library packages; services implement them.
3. **Schema-per-service.** Each service owns its Postgres schema. Never query another service's database.
4. **Event-driven.** Mutations publish events to NATS. Consumers are idempotent.
5. **Auth flow.** User → Keycloak JWT → service validates → governance/authz checks.

## Test Summary

| Area | Tests |
|------|-------|
| Core libraries (spec, events, authz) | 45 |
| Standalone services (approvals, mcp-gateway, etc.) | 133 |
| Core services (registry, packages, governance, state) | 72 |
| E2E integration | 28 |
| **Total** | **278** |
