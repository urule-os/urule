## Strategy: Three Pillars

```
FIND IT          -->    TRY IT          -->    STAY & CONTRIBUTE
(Discovery)            (First Experience)       (Community)
```

## What Success Looks Like

**6 months from now**, someone searching for "open source AI agent platform" or "MCP tool registry" or "AI approval workflow" finds Urule in the top results. They:

1. See a professional README with badges, comparison, and quick start
2. Get running in under 5 minutes with `make dev`
3. Deploy their first agent from the template catalog
4. Chat with a real AI that can hire specialists and create tasks
5. Build a widget or adapter by following CLAUDE.md recipes
6. Submit their first PR by picking a "good first issue"
7. Tell their team about it

That's the flywheel.

## Funding Explained

### What is GitHub Sponsors?
GitHub Sponsors lets people and companies financially support open-source maintainers. The `FUNDING.yml` file adds a "Sponsor" button to your repo.

### How it works
1. You set up a profile at github.com/sponsors/PanoramicRum
2. Create tiers ($5/mo, $25/mo, $100/mo, etc.)
3. People click "Sponsor" on your repo and pay monthly
4. GitHub takes 0% fees (they subsidize the program)
5. Money goes to your bank account via Stripe

### Why it matters
- Signals the project is actively maintained
- Funds your time to review PRs, triage issues, ship features
- Companies sponsor projects they depend on (it's normal)
- Even $500/mo covers meaningful development time

### When to activate
- Set it up now (it takes a few days for GitHub to approve)
- Don't expect income immediately — it grows with stars and adoption
- The button's presence alone adds credibility
