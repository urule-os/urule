# Urule User Journeys

A comprehensive map of every user journey in the Urule platform — with manual UX test checklists, automated Playwright tests, and future improvement ideas.

---

## How to Run Tests

### Automated (Playwright)

```bash
# Prerequisites: Node.js 20+, Playwright browsers
cd apps/office-ui
npm install
npx playwright install chromium

# Run all E2E tests (starts dev server automatically)
npm run e2e

# Run with browser visible
npm run e2e:headed

# Run with interactive UI mode (pick & debug tests)
npm run e2e:ui

# Run a specific journey
npx playwright test auth
npx playwright test dashboard
npx playwright test chat

# View HTML report
npm run e2e:report
```

### Manual Testing

1. Start the full stack: `make infra-up` (or `docker compose -f infra/compose/docker-compose.phase6.yaml up --build -d`)
2. Start the UI: `cd apps/office-ui && npm run dev`
3. Open http://localhost:3000
4. Use "Demo Login" for quick access (no Keycloak needed)
5. Follow the checklists below for each journey

### With Docker Compose (full stack)

```bash
# Boot everything including backend services
make infra-up

# Run E2E tests against the full stack
cd apps/office-ui && BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 npm run e2e
```

## Contributing New Journeys

Want to add a new user journey or test case?

1. **Document the journey** — Add a new section to this file following the existing format (steps table + UX tests + future improvements)
2. **Write the Playwright spec** — Create `apps/office-ui/e2e/<journey-name>.spec.ts` matching your journey
3. **Use the auth fixture** — Import `{ test, expect } from './fixtures/auth'` for authenticated tests
4. **Submit a PR** — Reference the journey section in your PR description

### Test File Structure
